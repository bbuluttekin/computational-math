# Computational Mathematics

These micro modules are created as part of the data science challenge for [HSBC and Cambridge spark](https://cambridgespark.com/hsbc-student-events-case-study/) data science career event. 

## Modules Included 

### Linear algebra
- gradient: Calculates the gradient of function `f(X) = w1 * x1^2 + w2 * x2` at the point x.
- metrics: Given two vectors calculates the `l1` and `l2` distances. 
- list_mul: Given two vectors calculates and returns, element-wise sum, element-wise product and dot product.
- matrix_mul: Given two matrices A and B represented as list of list, implements the function to multiply them together (A * B)

### Maths 
- derivative: Given the function `f(x) = w1 * x^3 + w2 * x - 1` evaluates the derivative of the function on x.
- abs_dist: Returns the absolute value of x
- fact: Returns the factorial of the value x.
- combination: Given n total number of items, what is the number of possible ways to choose r items from it.
### Probabilities
- head_tails: Given a coin that have probability p of giving a heads in each toss independently, returns the probability of having n heads consecutively in a row.
- bin_dist: Given a number of trials, p the probability of success, returns the probability of having x successes.
- bin_cdf: Given number of trials, p the probability of success, returns the probability of having less than or equal to x successes.
