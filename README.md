# Computational Mathematics

These micro modules are created as part of the data science challenge for [HSBC and Cambridge spark](https://cambridgespark.com/hsbc-student-events-case-study/) data science career event. 

## Modules Included 

### Linear algebra
- gradient: Calculates the gradient of function `f(X) = w1 * x1^2 + w2 * x2` at the point x.
- metrics: Given two vectors calculates the `l1` and `l2` distances. 
- list_mul: Given two vectors calculates and returns, element-wise sum, element-wise product and dot product.
- matrix_mul: Given two matrices A and B represented as list of list, implements the function to multiply them together (A * B)
